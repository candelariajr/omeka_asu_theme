# PENDING UPDATES #
CSS Will be retooled with more Bootstrap 4 options allowing for customization of BS in a general Omeka Implementation.
These will happen along with the Solr Plugin Rewrite in Summer 2022.

# omeka_asu_theme
Omeka theme with Bootstrap4 modeled after ASU's Comm template

# Instructions: 
Drag-drop into themes folder

# Issues:
Links are not relative: Some are completely broken
JS Hacks were put in place for MVP presentation
This is an exhibit theme not a full production theme
General bugs and mess.

# Edit Notes for Bootstrap Implementation in Omeka:
A plugin folder is now added instead of including edit instructions. 
Copy these directories into the plugins folder, overwriting the ones currently in place.
